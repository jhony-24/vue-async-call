# Vue async call


### Basic usage

Here to resolve async promises we use 
the composable **useAsync**. This basically take 
four reactive values and a method 
exec to listen changes. It's all.ðŸ˜ƒ

```javascript
import { useAsync } from "vue-async-call";

const { 
 data, 
 loading, 
 error, 
 idl,
 exec 
} = useAsync();


exec(() => api.fetchUsers());
// or
exec(api.fetchUsers());
```

In some cases is important initialize values, 
It is posible passing and object value.

```javascript
const { data } = useAsync({
  data: [],
});
```
Him default value is undefined but now it's an array.
Is it possible to use multiple useAsync together?, 
we use the reactive from vue to have multiple async options.

````javascript
import { reactive } from "vue";
const users = reactive(useAsync());
const jobs = reactive(useAsync());

// using it
console.log(users.data);
console.log(jobs.data);
````

### Typescript
Define just an interface and you pass it as an generic type.

```typescript
interface User {
   name: string;
   age: number;
}
const { data } = useAsync<User[]>();
```
